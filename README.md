Wireless Networks Lab(WINE) is in the Department of Information Convergence Engineering at the Pusan National University and is led by Professor Won-Joo Hwang.

Our research spans a broad range of topics which are mainly categorized into 2 branches:
1. AI for wireless which includes the application of AI in network and user device, in wireless sensing, in data transfer and in driven AI.
2. Application of mathematical tools such as network optimization, game theory, random process and machine learning to cutting-edge research topics, i.e. 5G/B5G networks, Mobile edge/cloud computing, IoT, D2D, CRN, UAV and Massive MIMO.

We seek a principled understanding of new and emerging areas through a complementary mix of theoretical and applied experimental research.
